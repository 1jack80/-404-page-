Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your
project by answering:

**Where can I see your demo?**

it is coming out soon... stay tuned for that

**What was My experience?**

Short and simple. This project took me less thatn an hour to build and the fact that i didnt need to
use media queries here means a lot to me since my knowledge in css grids have really been a drag
hitherto this challenge.

**What I have learned/improved?**

I have come to believe the best way to solve a layout problem is to start with mobile and then work
your way up from there.

here's a Pro tip: by default, the content placed in browsers are responsive... text and images( when
they have a max width set to 100%) so in order to ease your development process, try to set the
least amount of rules you can while still achieving the layout you want... ðŸ¤­ Trust me, its harder
than it sounds.

Also, I have gained a deeper understanding of grids and how they can be used to really bring life to
layouts in html with ease.

### Built With

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a
[DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The
[challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to
complete the given user stories.

The app runs fully responsive without the use of media queries all with the use of grids
