**Where can I see your demo?** https://1jack80-404.netlify.app

**What was My experience?** Short and simple. This project took me less thatn an
hour to build and the fact that i didnt need to use media queries here means a
lot to me since my knowledge in css grids have really been a drag hitherto this
challenge.

**What I have learned/improved?** I have come to believe the best way to solve a
layout problem is to start with mobile and then work your way up from there.

here's a Pro tip: by default, the content placed in browsers are responsive...
text and images( when they have a max width set to 100%) so in order to ease
your development process, try to set the least amount of rules you can while
still achieving the layout you want... ðŸ¤­ Trust me, its harder than it sounds.

Also, I have gained a deeper understanding of grids and how they can be used to
really bring life to layouts in html with ease.

### Built With

- [Reactjs with Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev)

This application/site was created as a submission to a
[DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The
[challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to
build an application to complete the given user stories.

---

The app runs fully responsive without the use of media queries all with the use
of grids

- See the source code to learn more how this works
